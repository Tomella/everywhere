# everywhere
Geolocate locations from the original "I've been everywhere" song. 

[I've been everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ve_Been_Everywhere)

It's just static content although you can run a local server http://localhost:3000 by running `node server` from the base directory.

Everything is served from the web directory. I've got it running [here](https://everywhere.geospeedster.com)

It isn't the greatest code and I should tidy up a bit. Particularly in map.js which is supposed to be generic but has some app specific coding in it.

The master data is in <project>/data and the deployable artefacts are generated by programs
tools> node project.js               # Generates the geojson used for the murray river
tools> node oodnadatta_reduction.js  # Generates the geojson used for the Oodnadatta track
tools> node loadgpxfiles.js          # Generates the geojson for all the point locations.
