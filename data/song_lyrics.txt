Well, I was humpin’ my bluey
on the dusty Oodnadatta road
When along came a semi with a
high and canvas-covered load
“If you’re goin’ to Oodnadatta,
mate, um, with me you can ride.”
So I climbed in the cabin
and I settled down inside
He asked me if I’d seen a road
with so much dust and sand,
I said “Listen, mate, I’ve travelled
ev’ry road in this here land.”


Cos “I’ve been everywhere, man
I’ve been everywhere, man

I’ve breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I’ve had my share, man
I’ve been ev’rywhere
